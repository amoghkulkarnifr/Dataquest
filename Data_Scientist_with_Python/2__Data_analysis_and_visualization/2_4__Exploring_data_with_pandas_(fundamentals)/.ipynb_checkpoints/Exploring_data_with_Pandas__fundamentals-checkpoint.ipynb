    "<div><p>In the last mission, we learned the basics of the pandas library. We explored the primary data structure in pandas, the <strong>dataframe</strong>, and learned some of the ways pandas makes working with data easier than NumPy:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Axis values in dataframes can have string <strong>labels</strong>, not just numeric ones, which makes selecting data much easier.</li>\n",
    "<li>Dataframes can contain columns with <strong>multiple data types</strong>: including integer, float, and string.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>In this mission, we'll learn another way pandas makes working with data easier. It has many built-in methods and functions for common exploration and analysis tasks. As we learn these, we'll also explore how pandas uses many of the concepts we learned in the NumPy missions, including vectorized operations and boolean indexing.</p>\n",
    "<p>We'll continue working with a data set from <a href=\"http://fortune.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune</a> magazine's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_Global_500\" target=\"_blank\">Global 500 list</a> 2017, which ranks the top 500 corporations worldwide by revenue. The data set was originally compiled <a href=\"https://data.world/chasewillden/fortune-500-companies-2017\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>; however, we modified the original data set to make it more accessible.</p>\n",

    "<p>The index of the series that <code>Series.value_counts()</code> produces now shows us floats like <code>471.0</code> instead of integers. The reason behind this is that pandas uses the NumPy integer dtype, which does not support NaN values. Pandas inherits this behavior, and in instances where you try and assign a NaN value to an integer column, pandas will silently convert that column to a float dtype. If you're interested in finding out more about this, there is a <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/gotchas.html#nan-integer-na-values-and-na-type-promotions\" target=\"_blank\">specific section on integer NaN values in the pandas documentation</a>.</p>\n",

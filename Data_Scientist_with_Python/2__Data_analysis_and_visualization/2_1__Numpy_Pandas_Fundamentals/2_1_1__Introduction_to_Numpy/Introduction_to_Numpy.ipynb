    "When it comes to programming in Python, libraries are where the real power is. Similar to plugins or extensions, libraries unlock your code and make it more efficient. With a few fundamentals of Python programming, you can use libraries for high-performance data analysis and data visualization. In this lesson, we'll go over one of the most user-friendly libraries out there: NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/1.1-m289.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is very popular because it makes writing programs easy. Python is a high-level language, which means you don't have to allocate memory manually. With low-level languages, you have to define memory allocation and processing, which gives you more control over performance, but it also slows down your programming. NumPy gives you the best of both worlds: processing performance without all the allocation.\n",

    "# Introduction to Numpy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure in NumPy is the **ndarray** or **n-dimensional array**. In programming, **array** describes a collection of elements, similar to a list. The word **n-dimensional** refers to the fact that ndarrays can have one or more dimensions. We'll start by working with one-dimensional (1D) ndarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/2.1-m289.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the NumPy library, we first need to import it into our Python environment. It's common to import NumPy using the alias `np`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can directly convert a list to an ndarray using the [`numpy.array()` constructor](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.array.html). To create a 1D ndarray, we can pass in a single list:\n",

    "data_ndarray = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20])\n",

    "We used the syntax `np.array()` instead of `numpy.array()` because of our `import numpy as np` code. When we introduce new syntax, we'll always use the full name to describe it, and you'll need to substitute in the shorthand where it's appropriate.\n",

    "# Understanding Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndarrays and the NumPy library make it easier to manipulate and analyze data. Let's explore why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using standard Python, we might consider using **lists of lists** to represent datasets. While lists of lists work with small datasets, they aren't very good for larger data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example involving two columns of data. Each row contains two numbers we want to add together. Using standard Python, we could use a list-of-lists structure to store our data, and we could use **for loops** to iterate over that data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/3.1-m289.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In each iteration of our loop, Python turns our code into bytecode, and the bytecode asks our computer's processor to add the two numbers together:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/3.2-m289.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our computer would take eight processor cycles to process the eight rows of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy library takes advantage of a processor feature called **Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)** to process data faster. SIMD allows a processor to perform the same operation on multiple data points in a single processor cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/3.3-m289.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, using NumPy would only take two processor cycles — making it four times faster than standard Python alone. We call this concept of replacing for loops with operations applied to multiple data points at once vectorization, and ndarrays make vectorization possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore how **vectorization** makes our code faster and easier to execute throughout this lesson. On the next screen, we'll practice converting a real-world dataset from a list of lists to an ndarray."
